The functionality of this plugin is based on [strapi-plugin-entity-relationship-chart](https://github.com/node-vision/strapi-plugin-entity-relationship-chart), but the diagrams and UI are completely redesigned.  
Feel free to test it (probably on a dev environment!) and help me develop it further.


## ğŸ—º Roadmap
- [ ] Add "Save Image"
- [ ] Enable/Disable strapi content types (like `admin::api-token-permission`) directly from UI
- [ ] Hide nodes
- [ ] Save/Load diagram states
- [ ] Make sure the plugin is secure
- [ ] Publish ğŸš€
